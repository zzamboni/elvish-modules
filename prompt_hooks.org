#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
  # Convenience functions to add hooks to the prompt hook lists.
  # Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>
  # 
  # $edit:before-readline hooks are executed before right after the prompt is shown
  # $edit:after-readline hooks are executed after the user presses Enter, before
  #   the command is executed. The typed command is passed as argument.
  #
  # Use like this:
  # prompt_hooks:add-before-readline { code to execute }
  # prompt_hooks:add-after-readline { code to execute }
  #
  # Multiple hooks can be added, they execute in sequence.

  fn add-before-readline [hook]{
    edit:before-readline=[ $@edit:before-readline $hook ]
  }

  fn add-after-readline [hook]{
    edit:after-readline=[ $@edit:after-readline $hook ]
  }
