* Usage

Install the =elvish-modules= package using [[https://elvish.io/ref/epm.html][epm]] (you can put these statements in your =rc.elv= file as well, to automatically install the package upon startup if needed):

#+begin_src elvish
use epm
epm:install &silent-if-installed github.com/zzamboni/elvish-modules
#+end_src

In your =rc.elv=, load this module:

#+begin_src elvish
use github.com/zzamboni/elvish-modules/spinners
#+end_src

#+begin_src elvish :tangle spinners-examples.elv :export none
use github.com/zzamboni/elvish-modules/spinners
#+end_src
** Available spinners

The spinner definitions are taken from the [[https://github.com/sindresorhus/cli-spinners/][sindresorhus/cli-spinners]] project. You can view a demo of all the spinners with the =spinners:demo= command:

[[file:images/spinners-demo.gif]]

You can get the list of available spinners using the =spinners:list= function.

#+begin_src elvish :use github.com/zzamboni/elvish-modules/spinners :exports both
spinners:list | take 5
#+end_src

#+results:
: ▶ arc
: ▶ arrow
: ▶ arrow2
: ▶ arrow3
: ▶ balloon

** Showing spinner while a function runs

The easiest way to create a spinner is to use =spinners:run= to execute a lambda while displaying a spinner. The spinner will stop automatically when the lambda finishes:

#+begin_src elvish :tangle spinners-examples.elv
spinners:run { sleep 3 }
#+end_src

By default, the spinner specified by =$spinners:default-spinner= will be used. You can change this by passing the =&spinner= option. You can also specify a title to show next to the spinner by passing the =&title= option:

#+begin_src elvish :tangle spinners-examples.elv
spinners:run &spinner=arrow &title="Loading modules" { sleep 3 }
#+end_src

The input and output of =spinners:run= are connected to the lambda, so you can use it as part of a pipeline. E.g.:

#+begin_src elvish :tangle spinners-examples.elv
spinners:run &title=(styled "Counting files" blue) &style=green { fd . . } | count
fd . . | spinners:run &title="Counting characters in filenames" { each [f]{ all $f } } | count
#+end_src

The following options are available:

- =&spinner= - specify the spinner to use, by name. Default: =$spinners:default-spinner=.
- =&style= - string or list of [[https://elv.sh/ref/builtin.html#styled][style transformers]] that will be applied to the spinner (only to the spinner itself). Default: empty list.
- =&title= - string or [[https://elv.sh/ref/builtin.html#styled][styled object]] that will be shown after the spinner. Default: empty string.
- =&prefix= - string or  [[https://elv.sh/ref/builtin.html#styled][styled object]] that will be shown before the spinner. Default: empty string.
- =&indent= - integer indicating an indentation level. The indent will appear before =prefix= if both are given. Default: 0
- =&cursor= - boolean specifying whether the cursor should be shown while the spinner is running. Default: =$false=.
- =&persist= - if and how the spinner should persist at the end. See /Spinner persistence and exception handling/ below. Default: =$false=
- =&hide-exception= - boolean specifying whether an exception generated by the lambda should be displayed as usual or hidden (useful with =&persist=status=). Default: =$false=.

A spinner definition consists of frames and an interval. If you don't want to use one of the built-in spinners by specifying =&spinner=, you can use the following options to create a custom spinner:
- =&frames= - a string or list containing the different steps for the spinner.
- =&interval= - interval between the frames, in milliseconds.

If the lambda accepts an argument, the spinner ID will be passed to it. You can use it to manipulate the spinner while it runs using =spinners:attr= to modify its attributes and behavior (the same as the option names above). For example:

#+begin_src elvish :tangle spinners-examples.elv
spinners:run &title="Starting title" &persist=$true [s]{
  sleep 3
  spinners:attr $s title "New title!"
  sleep 3
  spinners:attr $s spinner shark
  spinners:attr $s style [ red ]
  sleep 3
  spinners:attr $s persist success
}
#+end_src

** Spinner persistence and exception handling

By default, the spinner disappears when it stops. Any exceptions thrown by the lambda are displayed as usual.

This behavior can be changed by the following options to =spinners:run=:

- =&hide-exception=: if set, exceptions thrown by the lamda are caught and hidden. Most useful with =&persist=status= (see below).
- =&persist=: if set, can have one of the following values:
  - =success=, =error=, =warning=, =info= are the default status symbols, defined in =$spinners:persist-symbols=:

    [[file:images/spinners-persist-symbols.jpg]]

  - =status=: if the lambda throws an exception sets =error=, otherwise =success=. Can be used with =&hide-exception=:

    [[file:images/spinners-persist-status.jpg]]

You can define custom persistence symbols by adding elements to =$spinners:persist-symbols=, indexed by the symbol name, and containing two keys =symbol= and =color=. For example:

#+begin_src elvish :tangle spinners-examples.elv
spinners:persist-symbols[unicorn] = [ &symbol="🦄" &color=default ]
spinners:run &title="Getting a unicorn" &persist=unicorn { sleep 3 }
#+end_src

[[file:images/spinners-persist-unicorn.gif]]

** Advanced use: manually starting and stopping spinners

If you want more flexibility in producing spinners, you can create, start and stop spinners by hand. The general sequence should be as follows:

1. Create a spinner using the =spinners:new= function. This function returns the ID of the new spinner, which you must store to use in spinner operations. The =spinners:new= function accepts the same options as =spinners:run= to specify the parameters of the spinner. For example:
   #+begin_src elvish :tangle spinners-examples.elv
s = (spinners:new &title="Test spinner" &persist=status &hide-exception)
   #+end_src
2. Start the spinner with the =spinners:start= function. This displays and starts the spinner running with a background function, so it returns immediately. *Note:* if you do this from the terminal, the spinner will display on top of the command line as you type other commands.
   #+begin_src elvish :tangle spinners-examples.elv
spinners:start $s
   #+end_src
3. While the spinner runs, you can use the =spinners:attr= function to set any of its attributes (the same as the option names in the =spinners:new= function) to modify the spinner on the fly. You can even change the spinner type by changing the =spinner= attribute. You can also persist and continue the current spinner and continue in a new line with =spinners:persist=, and also persist the current one and continue with a new one with the =spinners:persist-and-new= function, which takes the same arguments as the =spinners:run= function.
   #+begin_src elvish :tangle spinners-examples.elv
sleep 3
spinners:attr $s title "New title!"
sleep 2
spinners:persist $s
sleep 1
spinners:attr $s spinner shark
sleep 3
spinners:attr $s status ?(fail error)
spinners:persist-and-new $s &indent=2 &title=(styled "Next step" blue)
sleep 3
   #+end_src
4. Stop the spinner with the =spinners:stop= function. You can use the =&status= option to pass an exception object or =$ok= which can be used to determine the final state of the spinner (e.g. if you created it with =&persist=status=):
   #+begin_src elvish :tangle spinners-examples.elv
spinners:stop $s
   #+end_src

*Note:* if you call =spinners:start= and =spinners:stop= by hand, be aware that when the spinner stops Elvish will produce a notification about the background process. To prevent this you have to set =$notify-bg-job-success= to =$false= before calling =$spinners:stop=. This is not necessary if you use =spinners:run=.

During the execution of a spinner, the =spinners:persist= function can be used to persist the current spinner (according to its settings), move the cursor to the next line and continue running it. The =spinners:persist-and-new= function can be used to persist the current spinner (according to its settings), move the cursor to the next line, and then continue with a new spinner. This function accepts the same arguments as =spinners:run=, settings from the old spinner are *not* inherited.

** Modules

#+begin_src elvish
use str
use github.com/zzamboni/elvish-modules/tty
#+end_src

** Initialization

When the module is loaded, we read the spinner definitions from =spinners.json=.

#+begin_src elvish
spinners = (from-json < (path-dir (src)[name])/spinners.json)
#+end_src

By default the =dots= spinner is used.

#+begin_src elvish
default-spinner = 'dots'
#+end_src

We store spinners in the =$spinners:-sr= variable, indexed by ID.

#+begin_src elvish
-sr = [&]
#+end_src

** Utility functions

All output is produced through this function.

#+begin_src elvish
fn -output [@s]{
  print $@s >/dev/tty
}
#+end_src

** Spinner creation, advancing and status

A /spinner object/ is a definition of a spinner, and is a map containing the following keys:

- =spinner= - the name of one of the built-in spinners. This field implicitly defines =frames= and =interval=:
  - =frames= - a string or list containing the different steps for the spinner.
  - =interval= - interval between the frames, in milliseconds.
- =style= - an optional list of [[https://elv.sh/ref/builtin.html#styled][style transformers]] that will be applied to the spinner characters.
- =title= - an optional string or [[https://elv.sh/ref/builtin.html#styled][styled object]] that will be shown after the spinner.
- =prefix= - an optional string or  [[https://elv.sh/ref/builtin.html#styled][styled object]] that will be shown before the spinner.
- =indent= - an optional integer indicating an indentation level. The indent will appear before =prefix= if both are given.
- =cursor= - an optional boolean specifying whether the cursor should be shown while the spinner is running. Default is to hide it.
- =persist= - an optional boolean specifying whether the spinner should be left in place and the cursor moved to the next line when the spinner finishes running. By default the spinner is cleared when it finishes running, and the cursor stays at the beginning of the line.
- =current= - the current step of the spinner as it runs.
- =id= - unique identifier for the spinner. By default generated as a random number, but can be specified using the =&id= option if desired.

=spinners:new= creates a new spinner object containing the keys above, stores it in the registry, and returns its ID. The =&spinner= option can be used to initialize =&frames= and =&interval= from the default spinner definitions. If not given, =$spinners:default-spinner= is used. If =&frames= and =&interval= are given, they are used to override the default values. =&title=, =&prefix= and =&style= default to empty.

#+begin_src elvish
fn new [&spinner=$nil &frames=$nil &interval=$nil &title="" &style=[] &prefix="" &indent=0 &cursor=$false &persist=$false &hide-exception=$false &id=$nil]{
  # Determine ID to use
  id = (or $id (e=?(uuidgen)) (randint 0 9999999))
  # Use default spinner if none is specified
  if (not $spinner) { spinner = $default-spinner }
  # Automatically convert non-list styles, so you can do e.g. &style=red
  if (not-eq (kind-of $style) list) { style = [$style] }
  # Create and store the new spinner object
  -sr[$id] = [
    &id=             $id
    &spinner=        $spinner
    &frames=         (or $frames $spinners[$spinner][frames])
    &interval=       (or $interval $spinners[$spinner][interval])
    &title=          $title
    &prefix=         $prefix
    &indent=         $indent
    &style=          $style
    &cursor=         $cursor
    &persist=        $persist
    &hide-exception= $hide-exception
    &current=        0
    &status=         $ok
    &stop=           $false
  ]
  # Return ID of the new spinner
  put $id
}
#+end_src

Once a spinner object is created, =spinners:step= can be used to display and advance the spinner. This function returns an updated spinner object, which needs to be stored by the caller (Elvish does not support modifying arguments by reference).

#+begin_src elvish
fn step [spinner]{
  steps = $-sr[$spinner][frames]
  indentation = (str:join '' [(repeat $-sr[$spinner][indent] ' ')])
  pre-string = (if (not-eq $-sr[$spinner][prefix] '') { put $-sr[$spinner][prefix]' ' } else { put '' })
  post-string = (if (not-eq $-sr[$spinner][title] '') { put ' '$-sr[$spinner][title] } else { put '' })
  tty:set-cursor-pos (all $-sr[$spinner][initial-pos])
  -output $indentation$pre-string(styled $steps[$-sr[$spinner][current]] (all $-sr[$spinner][style]))$post-string
  tty:clear-line
  inc = 1
  if (eq (kind-of $steps string)) {
    inc = (count $steps[$-sr[$spinner][current]])
  }
  -sr[$spinner][current] = (% (+ $-sr[$spinner][current] $inc) (count $steps))
}
#+end_src

Set the status of the spinner to different outcomes, will be displayed the next time the =step= function is called. The definition of the symbols to display can be customized by adding or changing elements in =$spinners:persist-symbols=.

#+begin_src elvish
persist-symbols = [
  &success= [ &symbol="✔" &color=green ]
  &error=   [ &symbol="✖" &color=red ]
  &warning= [ &symbol="⚠" &color=yellow ]
  &info=    [ &symbol="ℹ" &color=blue ]
]
#+end_src

#+begin_src elvish
fn set-symbol [spinner symbol]{
  -sr[$spinner][frames] = [ $persist-symbols[$symbol][symbol] ]
  -sr[$spinner][style] = [ $persist-symbols[$symbol][color] ]
  -sr[$spinner][current] = 0
}
#+end_src

Wait an amount of time as defined by the spinner's =interval= field.

#+begin_src elvish
fn spinner-sleep [s]{
  sleep (to-string (/ $-sr[$s][interval] 1000))
}
#+end_src

Persist a spinner by setting its symbol to the one corresponding to its =persist= field (if any, otherwise just leave it as-is), and then moving the cursor to the next line and storing the new position as the spinner's =initial-pos= field.

#+begin_src elvish
fn persist [spinner]{
  if (eq $-sr[$spinner][persist] status) {
    if $-sr[$spinner][status] {
      set-symbol $spinner success
    } else {
      set-symbol $spinner error
    }
  } elif (eq (kind-of $-sr[$spinner][persist]) string) {
    set-symbol $spinner $-sr[$spinner][persist]
  }
  step $spinner
  -output "\n"
  -sr[$spinner][initial-pos] = [(tty:cursor-pos)]
}
#+end_src

Individual fields of a spinner can be queried or modified using the =spinners:attr= function. If no value is given, returns the value of the attribute, otherwise just sets it (no return value). The =spinner= field is treated specially by fetching the corresponding =frames= and =interval= attributes from the default spinner definitions, instead of just storing its value. It also resets the =current= counter to zero, since different spinners have different number of frames.

#+begin_src elvish
fn attr [id attr @val]{
  if (has-key $-sr $id) {
    if (eq $val []) {
      put $-sr[$id][$attr]
    } else {
      if (eq $attr spinner) {
        # Automatically populate frames and interval based on spinner
        name = $val[0]
        -sr[$id][spinner]  = $name
        -sr[$id][frames]   = $spinners[$name][frames]
        -sr[$id][interval] = $spinners[$name][interval]
        -sr[$id][current]  = 0
      } elif (eq $attr style) {
        # Automatically convert non-list styles, so you can do e.g. &style=red
        style = $val[0]
        if (not-eq (kind-of $style) list) { style = [$style] }
        -sr[$id][style] = $style
      } else {
        -sr[$id][$attr] = $val[0]
      }
    }
  } else {
    fail "Nonexisting spinner with ID "$id
  }
}
#+end_src

** Starting and stopping a spinner

Start a and stop a background spinner. The spinner is shown by a background function which will run until the spinner's =stop= flag is set.

*Note:* if you call =spinners:start= and =spinners:stop= by hand, be aware that when the spinner stops Elvish will produce a notification about the background process. To prevent this you have to set =$notify-bg-job-success= to =$false= before calling =$spinners:stop=. This is not necessary if you use =spinners:run=.

The =spinners:do-spinner= function is the one that actually does the work of:

- Hiding the cursor if necessary;
- Cycling the spinner until its =stop= field is set (this requires a parallel process that sets this flag eventually);
- Persisting the spinner with the appropriate symbol or clearing it, according to its configuration;
- Reissuing any exceptions, if necessary;
- Deleting the spinner definition from the internal registry.

#+begin_src elvish
fn do-spinner [spinner]{
  if (not $-sr[$spinner][cursor]) {
    tty:hide-cursor
  }
  -sr[$spinner][initial-pos] = [(tty:cursor-pos)]
  while (not $-sr[$spinner][stop]) {
    step $spinner
    spinner-sleep $spinner
    if (has-key $-sr[$spinner] next-spinner-id) {
      next-spinner-id = $-sr[$spinner][next-spinner-id]
      # Indicator to persist the current spinner and continue with a new definition
      persist $spinner
      -sr[$spinner] = $-sr[$next-spinner-id]
      -sr[$spinner][id] = $spinner
      -sr[$spinner][initial-pos] = [(tty:cursor-pos)]
      del -sr[$next-spinner-id]
    }
  }
  if $-sr[$spinner][persist] {
    persist $spinner
  } else {
    tty:set-cursor-pos (all $-sr[$spinner][initial-pos])
    tty:clear-line
  }
  if (not $-sr[$spinner][cursor]) { tty:show-cursor }
  if (and (not $-sr[$spinner][status]) (not $-sr[$spinner][hide-exception])) {
    show $-sr[$spinner][status]
  }
  del -sr[$spinner]
}
#+end_src

The =spinners:start= function simply calls =do-spinner= in the background.

#+begin_src elvish
fn start [spinner]{
  do-spinner $spinner &
}
#+end_src

Stop execution of a spinner by setting its =stop= flag. This will be caught by the spinner process in the background, which does the work of stopping, persisting and removing the spinner. The =&status= option should be used to pass an exception object used to set the status of the spinner.

#+begin_src elvish
fn stop [spinner &status=$ok]{
  -sr[$spinner][status] = $status
  -sr[$spinner][stop] = $true
}
#+end_src

** Running a function with a spinner

Simplest point of entry for displaying a spinner while a function is running. Takes a lambda as the only mandatory argument. A spinner will be automatically created and displayed until the lambda finishes. It takes the same options as =spinners:new=, which can be used to specify the details of the spinner to use.

#+begin_src elvish
fn run [&spinner=$nil &frames=$nil &interval=$nil &title="" &style=[] &prefix="" &indent=0 &cursor=$false &persist=$false &hide-exception=$false f]{
  # Create spinner
  s = (new &spinner=$spinner &frames=$frames &interval=$interval &title=$title &style=$style &prefix=$prefix &indent=$indent &cursor=$cursor &persist=$persist &hide-exception=$hide-exception)
  # Determine whether to pass the spinner ID to the function
  f-args = [$s]
  if (eq $f[arg-names] []) { f-args = [] }
  # Run spinner in parallel with the function
  status = $ok
  run-parallel {
    do-spinner $s
  } {
    status = $ok
    try {
      $f $@f-args
    } except e {
      status = $e
    } finally {
      # Short pause to avoid a potential race condition when the
      # function finishes too quickly
      sleep 0.05
      stop &status=$status $s
    }
  }
}
#+end_src

During the execution of a spinner, the =spinners:persist-and-new= function can be used to persist the current spinner (according to its settings), move the cursor to the next line, and then continue with a new spinner. This function accepts the same arguments as =spinners:run=, settings from the old spinner are *not* inherited.

#+begin_src elvish
fn persist-and-new [old-spinner &spinner=$nil &frames=$nil &interval=$nil &title="" &style=[] &prefix="" &indent=0 &cursor=$false &persist=$false &hide-exception=$false]{
  new-spinner = (new &spinner=$spinner &frames=$frames &interval=$interval &title=$title &style=$style &prefix=$prefix &indent=$indent &cursor=$cursor &persist=$persist &hide-exception=$hide-exception)
  -sr[$old-spinner][next-spinner-id] = $new-spinner
}
#+end_src
** List and demo mode

Return the list of available spinners

#+begin_src elvish
fn list {
  keys $spinners | order
}
#+end_src

Produce all the spinners in sequence.

#+begin_src elvish
fn demo [&time=2 &style=blue &persist=$false]{
  list | each [s]{
    run &spinner=$s &title=$s &style=$style &persist=$persist { sleep $time }
  }
}
#+end_src
