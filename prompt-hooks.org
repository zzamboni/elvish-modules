- [[#implementation][Implementation]]

* Usage

Install the =elvish-modules= package using [[https://elvish.io/ref/epm.html][epm]]:

#+begin_src elvish
use epm
epm:install github.com/zzamboni/elvish-modules
#+end_src

In your =rc.elv=, load this module:

#+begin_src elvish
use github.com/zzamboni/elvish-modules/prompt-hooks
#+end_src

=$edit:before-readline= hooks are executed before right after the prompt is shown. =$edit:after-readline= hooks are executed after the user presses Enter, before the command is executed. The typed command is passed as argument to =after-readline= hooks.

Use like this:

#+begin_src elvish
prompt-hooks:add-before-readline { code to execute } ...
prompt-hooks:add-after-readline { code to execute } ...
#+end_src

Multiple hooks can be added, they execute in sequence.

* Implementation
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:elvish: :tangle (concat (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name)) ".elv")
:header-args: :mkdirp yes :comments no
:END:

Each function adds the given hooks to the corresponding variable, if it's not there already.

#+begin_src elvish
fn add-before-readline [@hooks]{
  each [hook]{
    if (not (has-value $edit:before-readline $hook)) {
      edit:before-readline=[ $@edit:before-readline $hook ]
    }
  } $hooks
}

fn add-after-readline [@hooks]{
  each [hook]{
    if (not (has-value $edit:after-readline $hook)) {
      edit:after-readline=[ $@edit:after-readline $hook ]
    }
  } $hooks
}
#+end_src
